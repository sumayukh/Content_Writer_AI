About the book :
""Snippets Of An Idle Mind"" is a collection of short stories and poems. It comprises twenty-one pieces that delve into the nuances of life, the beauty of nature, and the complexity of the human psyche. From stories of emotions we process to tales of coming of age, from introspective poems about love and memories to abstract pieces on the concept of time and the nature of things, this book offers a range of perspectives on the world around us. I sincerely hope that readers will find in these pages, a reflection of their own experiences and a reminder of the wonder that surrounds us every day.",80
"I'm a painter and the world is my canvas. I paint new limits for me called standards. Every time I pick up the brush, I breathe life into my phantoms. They stay hidden inside a closet. Handcuffed. But sometimes I draw their colours in Like paper soaking bad blood. One can't tame them now really, can one? One can't get rid of them all, at once. One gets lost in the rhythm of it all as one Can't lock them up all in a mansion Haunted by the random Efforts to search for tandem, In the middle of the mind's madness, Considering we still have one. I'm a painter and the world is my canvas. I paint new limits for me called standards. Every time I pick up the brush, I breathe life into my phantoms. I seldom paint any attachments. I toss them off when I have them. Because if I don't, I'll end up shattered And that too without any fragments. People say I'm emotionally absent. Emotionally, I've turned stagnant. It's these flowers of creativity That add worth to life, When they bloom on the tomb of my Palate's true vice, When the soul gets battered by time's Rampage too nice. They splurge colour into my Portrayals of absence. Sculpted by these hands, Drunk on absinthe. And give meaning to my lifeless captions Through lies. I'm a painter and the world is my canvas. I paint new limits for me called standards. Every time I pick up the brush, I breathe life into my phantoms.

"It was ridiculously cold outside. But to be fair, I'd always known my Daadi as the free-spirited, rebellious elder in the family. It's why I liked her.

I sat down in the chair adjacent to her. She stirred the fire while staring blankly into the night sky, when I handed her the bottle of a 30-year-old McKenna. “The berries I promised”, I added. For a very brief moment there, I saw her big wide eyes sparkle in excitement. Then the usual unimpressed, make-believe routine replaced it. I popped the bottle and poured both of us a glass each.

“So, how's work?”, she asked after a few sips and the initial struggle to make conversation.

“Oh, I don't know”, I replied. “It just feels like a lot at times. But I manage.”

“Yeah, bet you do. You're my blood after all”. We both chuckled at that.

It was our thing. We used to deliberately assume credit for one another's qualities. Over the years, it had become something of a contest between us.

We both paused for a second and looked at each other. Something familiarly strange came over me and I said to her, “I've missed you. I'm sorry I could not....”

I couldn't even finish that sentence when a strange feeling overwhelmed me. The wind had become colder suddenly and the bottle in my hand felt empty. I felt like I had lost my hearing ability and was beginning to lose my eyesight too. My chest felt so heavy now that I started gasping for air.

I struggled with what seemed like a never-ending nightmare, for a while there. The overwhelming headache started to wear off. The morning sun of a foggy January was hurting my eyes now. Soon enough, a voice amplified. It sounded like it was approaching rapidly. A few seconds later, I saw a man standing beside me. He was yelling at me in fury.

“Who are you, sir? How long have you been here!!”

I was only trying to figure out my senses and whereabouts when the man spoke again.
“I'm afraid I'll have to check your ID sir”, he said. “We don't let anybody wander about in the open here. It was the landlady's dying wish to be buried in peace. Word around the corner is that even though she has left us, her lonely spirit is still here and occasionally visits her grave.”

'Ghosts' is a tale of loss that explores the theme through a grieving man's perspective. It explores how often we get caught up with the world revolving around us and gradually become absent from the lives of those who mean the world to us. More often than not, these acts of 'casual ghosting' return later on and haunt us in life as grief and regret, especially when we lose someone. The story also hints at the duality of life and death, as those of us taken away by death live on forever in the memory of their loved ones, who thereafter tear themselves apart. The ones in mourning give up the will to live and wander about like a presence cursed with a beating heart.
